# XDiets

Final Project for Coding Dojo Python Fullstack Bootcamp.

Page where the user will be able to create and track different diets and recipes, and know the specific nutritional value of the recipes so they know exactly how much calories, proteins, carbs and fats they are eating.

The user will also be able to use the food database which includes all the nutritional value of these, which in turn can be used to create different recipes, which later will be used to create different diets.

The technologies used for the project where:
* DATABASE: MySQL
